# Topic: Arrays and Bird Trajectory

## Present Class Work :

- Created the vanishing pig.

## Present Class Work :

- Learn about the array data structure and how data is stored inside them. 
- Use the array data structure to design the bird's trajectory after it has been launched. 
- Use the concept of game state to stop the bird from being draggable after the bird is launched.

STEPS:

1. Clone the project from the last class.
   - $ git clone https://github.com/whitehatjr/AngryBirdsStage6

2. There are different ways in which any information or data can be stored inside a program. 

   - Question:  What is the most common way in which we have stored data in our programs? 

   - Answer: Using variables.

   - Question: What are the different types of data, we can store inside a variable?

   - Answer: 

     ```
      String: These aresequence of characters stored inside quotes.
     - Number: Any mathematical number.
     - Boolean values: True and false values.
     
     ```

     

3. There are also two special types of data - 

   ```
   - Null: It means nothing or empty. 
   - Undefined: It means that no value has been assigned to a variable. 
   ```

   

   - A single variable in javascript can hold any of these types of data. Different data types can also be reassigned to a single variable. 

   - Let's look at each of these with an example. 

   - Write code in script.js file to experiemnt with examples.

     ```
     var string ="this is a string";
     console.log(string);
     
     var num =100;
     console.log(num);
     
     var boolen =true;
     console.log(boolean);
     
     var object ;
     console.log(object);
     
     var object = null;
     console.log(object);
     
     ```

     

4. Question: disadvantage of storing data in a single variable?

   - Answer: We can store only one value at a time.

   - Question: What to do  if we want to store several values at once? 

   - Answer: One possible solution is to create separate single variables for each value. 

   - Question: What do you think about this? 

   - Answer: We can store only one value at a time.  Too cumbersome to create a variable for each value. It would also make our code unreadable.

     

## To avoid this problem, Javascript and most other languages have different data structures to hold multiple values. One popular data structure to hold multiple values is called an "array". An array is created inside square brackets and can store a list of same or different types of data separated by a comma.

5.  Example :

   ```
   var arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
   comsole.log(arr1);
   
   var arr2 = ["name", 12, true];
   console.log(arr2);
   
   ```

   

### 6. An array can also store a list of arrays!!

```
var arr3 = [ [1,2] , [2,3], [3,4] ] ;
console.log(arr2);

```

- Each value in the array is indexed by a number.

- The first value has an index of '0', the second value has an index of '1' and so on.(Counting always starts from 0 in most computer languages.) 

- If we want to access the first element of our arr3 array, we can access it by using arr3[0]

  ```
  console.log(arr3[0]);
  ```

  7. Question:  what if we wanted to access the second element inside the first element of the array?

     - We do this by adding a sub-index like this arr3 [0] [0] The second element of the first element in the array can be accessed with arr3 [0] [1].

       ```
       console.log(arr3[0][1]);
       ```

  8. A new value can be pushed inside an array by using array.push(). Similarly the last values can be popped out of the arrays using array.pop()

     ```
     var arr3 = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]];
     console.log(arr3);
     
     arr3.push("my name");
     cosnole.log(arr3);
     
     arr3.pop();
     console.log(arr3);
     
     ```

     

9. We will be using this concept of storing data inside an array to draw the trajectory of the bird. We will draw white smoke wherever the bird moves.

   ##### i. open bird.js

   ##### ii.  load the smoke image which we want to draw in the trajectory of the bird.

   ```
   this.smokeImage = laodImage("sprites/smoke.png");
   ```

   ##### iii.  create an empty array where we will store the positions where the bird has moved.

```
this.trajectory = [ ];

```

##### iv. display() function gets called in each frame. Let's find the position of the bird in each frame and store the values in the trajectory. Remember, we have to store the x and y position for each point the bird moves in its trajectory. We can store it as an array of arrays.

```
//this.body.position.x = mouseX;
//this.body.position.y = mouseY;
super.display();

var position = [this.body.position.x,this.body,position.y]
this.trajectory.push(position);
```

##### v. Now for each element in the array, we want to draw the smoke image at those positions. How can we draw the image? You can use ‘for’ loop to move over the arrays and image() function to draw the image at given points.

```
for(var i=0; i<this.trajectory.length;i++)
{
image(this.smokeImage,this.trajectory[i][0],this.trajectory[i][1]);
}
```

##### vi. there are smokes even when the bird has stopped. 

##### * How can we stop this from happening? 

##### * We can use simple if conditions to stop this from happening. 

##### * For example we can say to store the positions only when the velocity and position of the bird is above a threshold.

```
if(this.body.velocity.x>10 && this.body.position.x>200)
{
var position = [this.body.position.x,this.body,position.y]
this.trajectory.push(position);
}
```

10. The code seems to work  well.

    - There are two problems: 

      - 1. We can still press space and get the angry bird back to the slingshot. This creates multiple trajectories. We don't want this feature in a fair game. We can simply comment the instructions inside the attach function. 

           ```
           var gameState = "onSling";
           ```

           

      - 2. Our bird follows the mouse even after the collision! This allows the player to destroy the pigs even after they have missed. How can we stop that? We can instruct the computer to not follow the mouse after it has been launched. We can do this using gameStates. 

           ```
           function mouseDragged()
           {
           if(gameState!=="launched")
           {
           Matter.Body.setPosition(bird.body, {x: mouseX, y: mouseY});
           }
           }
           
           function mouseReleased()
           {
           slingshot.fly();
           gameState = "launched";
           }
           
           fucntion keyPrssed()
           {
           if(keyCode === 32)
           {
           // slingsgot.attach(bird.body);
           }
           }
           ```

           

# Learning from today's class:

1. There are different ways in which data can be stored inside a program. 
2. To store several values together, we use arrays.
3. We can access the arrays by their index. 
4. We used arrays to draw the trajectory of the bird.
